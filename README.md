Project structure is based on [evrone/go-clean-template](https://github.com/evrone/go-clean-template)

## Note

PostgreSQL repository implementation lacks proper errors.
That is, if the DB operation fails, errors are returned to the end user as is, which is not
a proper solution for the production environment.

Also, OpenAPI spec would be a nice touch, but it's missing.

## Running

This project uses [Mage](https://magefile.org/) as the build tool

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

From the [Mage](https://magefile.org/) website...

> Makefiles are hard to read and hard to write. Mostly because makefiles are
> essentially fancy bash scripts with significant white space and
> additional make-related syntax.
>
> Mage lets you have multiple magefiles, name your magefiles whatever
> you want, and they’re easy to customize for multiple operating systems.
> Mage has no dependencies (aside from go) and runs just fine on all major
> operating systems, whereas make generally uses bash which is not well
> supported on Windows. Go is superior to bash for any non-trivial task
> involving branching, looping, anything that’s not just straight line
> execution of commands. And if your project is written in Go, why
> introduce another language as idiosyncratic as bash?
> Why not use the language your contributors are already comfortable with?

To start the server run

```shell
mage full

# to show all available mage targets run
mage -l
```

This will spin up...

- Server inside a docker container on **port 8080**
- Spin up auxiliary containers with
    - PostgreSQL - The database
    - [PGWeb](https://github.com/sosedoff/pgweb) - Web UI for Postgres
- Run [migrations](./migrations) using [pressly/goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose)
- Load [example data](./example-data.sql) into the DB

To check if everything is working, run healthcheck

```shell
curl --location 'localhost:8080/v1/health'
```

## Configuration

Server is configured via... (by priority)

1. Environment variables. See [`.env.template`](./.env.template) for reference.
2. `.env` file
3. [TOML config file](./config/config.toml)
